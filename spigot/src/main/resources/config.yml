# Thanks for using Connection Guard, the free connection security plugin with premium quality.
# There is a lot to configure, if you want to. If not, you don't have to!
# If you leave it as default, Connection Guard will use ProxyCheck (https://proxycheck.io/)
# to check for vpn or proxy usage and block connections from those. For geo data, Connection Guard
# will use the IP-API (https://ip-api.com/) service.

# You can use multiple services at the same time (just enable multiple at once) to minimize
# the possibility of a false-flag. This number determines, how many of the enabled services have
# to report that an ip is a proxy/vpn, before the plugin will treat it as a proxy/vpn.
# Default value: 1
required-positive-flags: 1

# There are a lot of different services which help the plugin identify which
# IP is a vpn and which is not. Some work better than others and some have daily/monthly limits.

provider:
  vpn:
    # ProxyCheck is the most reliable service when it comes to detecting vpns and proxies.
    # Without an api key, it is limited to 100 requests daily (should work fine for 30-40 unique players
    # per day). With a free api key, which can be received after registration on https://proxycheck.io/,
    # 1.000 requests per day are free (should work fine for 300 unique players per day). Upgrades
    # are not very expensive, especially if you have a server with more than 300 unique players per day.

  cache:
    # The cache is very important to effectively use the requests you have and avoid running into the request limit.
    # Once a request to a service is made, its data is stored for the specified duration (see below) and used instead of
    # making a new request. This data does not change very frequently and you can cache the results for days, if you want to.
    # If you want to clear the cache, you can do that by typing in the command /connectionguard clearcache, which is especially
    # necessary when you add or remove countries to the geo-block-list.
    # Available types:
    # - SQLite (no further configuration is necessary, stored in a file in the plugins directory)
    # - Redis (configure connection details below, useful when deploying Connection Guard on multiple servers)
    # - Disabled (disable any caching, make absolutely sure that you don't run into request limits!)
