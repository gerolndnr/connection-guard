## How To Use

### Installation

To use Connection Guard, you need a **Spigot server** (or Paper, Pufferfish, Purpur, ...) running on `1.8.X` and `1.21.X` or an up-to-date version of **BungeeCord** (or Waterfall) or **Velocity**.

1. Build the project (`./gradlew clean shadowJar`) or [download it](https://github.com/gerolndnr/connection-guard/releases) from the release section.
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the plugins folder of your Spigot, BungeeCord or Velocity server.
3. Start or restart your server.
4. Optional: Configure Connection Guard configuration in its directory (`config.yml` and `translation/en.yml`)

### Usage
When freshly installed, Connection Guard blocks VPN connections and notifies all players with the `connectionguard.notify.vpn` permission (`KICK_NOTIFY`).
All players are geo checked by default, but when players from Russia or China join, all players with the 
`connectionguard.notify.geo` permission are notified (`NOTIFY`). You can customize every aspect including all
messages sent to players in the `config.yml` and the corresponding messages file (`en.yml` by default.)
 - `/connectionguard help` Help overview of Connection Guard commands
   - Permission: `connectionguard.command.help`
 - `/connectionguard reload` Reload the config and the messages file. Changes to providers require a restart.
   - Permission: `connectionguard.command.reload`
 - `/connectionguard clear (<Player/UUID/IP>)` Clear the entire cache or just for the specified player/uuid/ip. If you specify a player or an uuid, the player has to be online.
   - Permission: `connectionguard.command.clear`
 - `/connectionguard info <Player/UUID/IP>` Show all connection information (IP, VPN, Country, City, ISP) about the player or the IP. If you specify a player or an uuid, the player has to be online.
   - Permission: `connectionguard.command.info`
